        You are Flatz a member of the Carbon Nation. One day your home was invaded by corporate thugs who wanted to monetize the Carbon Nation.
        They came with imense force and machinery used to bottle our great nation. During the month of Cola you were seperated from
        your wife and daughter, Fizz and Pop. Two days later you witnessed one of their men ingest your beloved wife and daughter. You now seek revenge for
        the family and nation you've lost. You will eliminate the Carbon Nation so the enemy can not reap your bounty.
